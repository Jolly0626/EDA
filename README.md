#Exploratory Data Analysis on Diwali sales using PYTHON
Diwali Sales EDA Project


#Overview:
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Diwali sales data using Python. The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the sales data to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance during the Diwali festival season.
Dataset...

The dataset used for this project is Diwali sales analysis . The dataset contains [11239] rows and [15] columns, including variables such as Cust_name,Product_ID,Gender,Age Group,Age,Martial_Status,State,Zone,Product_category,Occupation,Orders,Amount,Status, unnamed1.


#Methodology:
The following steps were taken to analyze the data:

Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Data Visualization: Various visualization techniques were used to explore the data, including [list visualization types, e.g. bar charts].
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics for each variable (e.g. count, sum, average)


#Findings:
The analysis revealed several interesting insights, including:

[Insert finding 1, e.g. "most of the buyers are Females .Purchasing power of female is more then male."]
[Insert finding 2, e.g. "most of the buyers are from age group of 26-35 mostly females"]
[Insert finding 3, e.g. "most orders and total sales are heled in Uttarpradesh state."]


#Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies were used for this project:

Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: A Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Python libraries used for data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: A web-based interactive environment used for data exploration and visualization.
